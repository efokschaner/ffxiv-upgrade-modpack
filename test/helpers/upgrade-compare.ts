// Registry of INTENTIONAL divergences from TexTools' /upgrade output. Each rule is a

// meant to introduce (e.g. our BCn encoder differs, so compressed blocks differ but the
// tex header/dims and decoded pixels agree within our documented precision loss). It is
// NOT a blanket tolerance: `confirm` must be tight enough that any OTHER difference still
// fails. Files matched by no rule must be byte-identical to the golden. Starts empty; the
// transform sub-projects add rules with cited reasons as generated files land.
