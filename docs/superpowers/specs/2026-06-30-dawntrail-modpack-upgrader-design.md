# Dawntrail Modpack Upgrader — Static Site Design

**Date:** 2026-06-30 (roadmap refreshed 2026-07-06)
**Status:** Design signed off; foundation shipped, upgrade transforms in progress.
Codecs, container I/O, the golden harness, and the material round are merged — see
§8 for the living roadmap of the full upgrade and what remains.
**Goal:** Build a static, client-side website (hostable on GitHub Pages) that performs the single
operation of **upgrading a pre-Dawntrail FFXIV modpack to Dawntrail format** — the equivalent of
TexTools' *Tools → Dawntrail Upgrades → Upgrade Modpack*.

---

## 1. Summary of decisions so far

| Topic | Decision |
|---|---|
| Approach | **Hand-port** the upgrade logic from C# to **TypeScript/JS** running fully client-side. (Not Blazor WASM, not a server.) |
| Hosting | Static site, GitHub Pages. No backend. All processing in-browser. |
| Scope | **Full parity** with the desktop op: both `.ttmp2` and `.pmp` (and unzipped PMP folders), core model/material/texture upgrade, eye mods, **and** the "partial texture-only hair/accessory" heuristics. |
| Game install needed at runtime? | **No.** Core upgrade is self-contained on the modpack's own files. A small, finite set of reference assets is **bundled** with the site (extracted once from the game via TexTools — see §5). |
| Confidence strategy | Differential "golden" testing against the **real `ConsoleTools.exe`** that ships with the user's installed TexTools (see §6). |

---

## 2. Where the real operation lives

The desktop app `FFXIV_TexTools_UI` is a thin WPF shell. The actual logic is in the
**`xivModdingFramework`** library.

- Repos (GitHub, org `TexTools`):
  - `https://github.com/TexTools/xivModdingFramework` (branches: `master`, `develop` — UI submodule tracks `develop`)
  - `https://github.com/TexTools/FFXIV_TexTools_UI`
- The originally-referenced `liinko/FFXIV_TexTools2` is an **old, pre-Dawntrail** version — ignore it.

### Key source files (paths relative to `xivModdingFramework/xivModdingFramework/`)

| File | ~Lines | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `Mods/ModpackUpgrader.cs` | 503 | **Entry point.** `UpgradeModpack(path, includePartials)` → orchestrates the whole upgrade. |
| `Mods/EndwalkerUpgrade.cs` | ~1,900 | **Core transforms** (Endwalker→Dawntrail) for materials, models, textures, hair, eyes. |
| `Mods/WizardData.cs` | ~1,515 | In-memory modpack model. `FromModpack` / `WriteModpack`. Both `.ttmp2` and `.pmp` map to this. |
| `Mods/FileTypes/TTMP.cs` | ~1,307 | `.ttmp2` container read/write (zip: `TTMPL.mpl` JSON + `TTMPD.mpd` binary blob). |
| `Mods/FileTypes/PMP.cs` | ~1,420 | `.pmp` container read/write (zip: `meta.json` + group JSON + individual files). |
| `Materials/FileTypes/Mtrl.cs` | ~1,635 | `.mtrl` material parse/serialize (`GetXivMtrl` / `XivMtrlToUncompressedMtrl`). |
| `Models/FileTypes/Mdl.cs` | ~4,472 | `.mdl` model parse/serialize + EW→DT model fixes. |
| `Textures/FileTypes/Tex.cs` | ~1,356 | `.tex` parse/serialize, DDS<->tex conversion, mipmaps. |
| `Materials/FileTypes/STM.cs` | — | Colorset/dye (STM) handling. |

Entry call chain (modpack-upgrade path, invoked with the modpack's own `files` dict and `tx = null`):
`ModpackUpgrader.UpgradeModpack` → `WizardData.FromModpack` → `ResolveHighlightOptionsAndMashupHair` →
`EndwalkerUpgrade.UpdateEndwalkerFiles(files)` (materials, then models, then partials) →
`EndwalkerUpgrade.UpgradeRemainingTextures` → (`includePartials`) unclaimed hair / eye passes →
`WizardData.WriteModpack`.

### Headless reference: `ConsoleTools`
`FFXIV_TexTools_UI/ConsoleTools/Program.cs` is a CLI that calls
`ModpackUpgrader.UpgradeModpack(src, dest)` directly. Commands: `/upgrade`, `/resave`, `/extract`,
`/wrap`, `/unwrap`, `/list`. **This is our golden oracle** (see §6).

---

## 3. The crucial finding: game-directory dependency is NOT a blocker

We traced every read of game-installation data reachable from the upgrade entry point. Files are
resolved via `EndwalkerUpgrade.ResolveFile(path, files, tx)`, which reads from the modpack's own
`files` dict first and only falls back to the game (`tx`) when `tx != null` — and the modpack path
passes `tx = null`.

**The core upgrade needs zero game assets.** Dawntrail "Index" map pixels are generated from the
modpack's own normal map + the colorset **embedded in its `.mtrl`** (`EndwalkerUpgrade.cs:1100-1112`).
The index texture path is derived by SE naming convention (`_n.tex`→`_id.tex`,
`EndwalkerUpgrade.cs:917-921`).

The reads an earlier analysis flagged as "essential" are all **degradable** or **fixed/bounded
reference data** — none require shipping the multi-GB game install:

| Read (EndwalkerUpgrade.cs) | What | Handling in port |
|---|---|---|
| `:926-936` (idPath refinement) | Fallback to canonical index path *only if* mtrl is a base-game file | **Degradable** — use convention path (`:917-921`); correct for ~all mods |
| `:1128`, `:1511` | `_SampleHair` — **one hardcoded** hair mtrl, source of DT hair shader constants | **Bundle** 1 extracted file |
| `:1928-1929` | `eye01_base.tex`, `eye01_mask.tex` — **two hardcoded** textures | **Bundle** 2 extracted files |
| `:2044-2056` | Iris material `mt_c{race}f{face}_iri_a.mtrl` → reads to get diffuse texture path | **Bundle** small `(race,face)→path` table (or derive by convention) |
| `:1428-1436`, `:~1615-1621` | Partial **texture-only** hair/accessory: read canonical hair/ear/tail mtrl to map loose textures to new paths | **Bundle** a precomputed canonical-material→sampler-path table (bounded set); only triggers for texture-only mods (`includePartials`) |
| `:65` `AssertIsDawntrail` | Pure guard | **Remove/stub** |

The framework itself already bundles reference data (not from the game) under
`xivModdingFramework/Resources/` — see §5.

### Hardcoded reference paths to remember
- `_SampleHair = "chara/human/c0801/obj/hair/h0115/material/v0001/mt_c0801h0115_hir_a.mtrl"`
- Eye: `"chara/common/texture/eye/eye01_base.tex"`, `"chara/common/texture/eye/eye01_mask.tex"`
- Iris format: `"chara/human/c{0}/obj/face/f{1}/material/mt_c{0}f{1}_iri_a.mtrl"` (race code, face)
- Partial hair canonical materials: from `hairset.MaterialFormat` (race, hair) — bounded set to enumerate.

## 4. Target architecture (TS/JS, static)

In-browser pipeline mirroring `ModpackUpgrader`:

```
Upload .ttmp2 / .pmp / folder
   │
   ▼
[Container reader]  ── zip (JSZip/fflate) → WizardData-equivalent model
   │
   ▼
[Pre-pass] resolve highlight/mashup hair
   │
   ▼
[Round 1] materials (.mtrl EW→DT) + models (.mdl EW→DT)   ← self-contained on modpack files
   │           └─ caches texture-upgrade targets
   ▼
[Round 2] textures: generate Index maps (normal+colorset → BC5), hair maps, gear masks
   │
   ▼
[Round 3, optional] partial texture-only hair / eye upgrades  ← uses bundled reference tables/assets
   │
   ▼
[Container writer] → new .ttmp2 / .pmp → browser download
```

Modules to port (each a focused unit with a clear interface):
- **zip container**: `.ttmp2` (TTMPL.mpl + TTMPD.mpd) and `.pmp` (meta/group JSON + files) readers/writers.
- **`.mtrl` codec**: parse/serialize, colorset + dye (STM) data, shader keys/constants.
- **`.tex` codec + DDS/BCn**: tex<->DDS, mipmaps, **BC5/BC7 encode/decode** (index maps use BC5;
  textures may be BC7). Needs a JS BCn implementation.
- **`.mdl` codec + EW→DT model fixes** (the largest piece).
- **transforms** (`EndwalkerUpgrade` equivalents): index-map generation, hair material migration,
  eye mask→diffuse, skin repaths, mashup-hair resolution.
- **bundled reference data** (see §5).

### Library-equivalents / porting notes
C# deps → JS analogs (or "avoid"):
- DotNetZip → `fflate` or `JSZip`
- SixLabors.ImageSharp → canvas/`ImageData` or a pure-JS image lib (resize, blur, channel ops)
- `JeremyAnsel.BcnSharp` (BC compression) → need a JS BCn encoder/decoder (BC5/BC7)
- `System.Data.SQLite` (XivCache) → **avoidable**; pre-convert any needed bundled `.db` rows to JSON,
  or use `sql.js` read-only for `uv_heuristics.db`/`shader_info.db` if genuinely required by the port.
- TeximpNet (FBX/Assimp), HelixToolkit (3D viewer) → **not needed** for the upgrade path.
- SharpDX.Mathematics → JS vector/half-float math (small).

---

## 5. Reference assets to bundle (extract once, ship with the site)

**Already in the framework** (`xivModdingFramework/xivModdingFramework/Resources/`):
- `DefaultTextures/`: `default_material.mtrl`, `default_material_dt.mtrl`, `Colorset.dat`, `Colorset.dds`,
  `Diffuse.dds`, `Multi.dds`, `Normal.dds`, `Other.dds`, `Specular.dds`
- `DB/`: `item_sets.db` (~2.5MB), `shader_info.db` (~118KB), `uv_heuristics.db` (~2.7MB)
- `ShaderConstants/`: `character.json`, `skin.json`; plus `ShaderKeys.json`

**Extract from game via `ConsoleTools /extract` (or `/unwrap`)** — exactly the files the upgrade reads:
- `_SampleHair` mtrl (hair shader constants)
- `eye01_base.tex`, `eye01_mask.tex`
- Iris materials for the bounded `(race, face)` set (only diffuse-sampler path needed → can reduce to a JSON table)
- Canonical hair/ear/tail materials for the partial path (only sampler paths needed → JSON table)

Goal: derive **minimal JSON lookup tables** (paths/metadata) rather than shipping raw assets where only
metadata is consumed. Keep the bundle small.

---

## 6. Confidence / testing strategy

No public tests exist (the `.sln` references `xivModdingFramework.xUnit` + `exChecker`, but neither is
committed to `master` or `develop`; no CI). We build our own, anchored on a **real golden oracle**:

**Oracle available:** the user has FFXIV (Dawntrail) **and** official TexTools installed.
- `ConsoleTools.exe`: `C:\Program Files\FFXIV TexTools\FFXIV_TexTools\ConsoleTools.exe`
- `console_config.json` already points `XivPath` at the Steam FFXIV install — `/upgrade` works out of the box (verified).

> ⚠️ **CORRECTION (2026-06-30, verified against a 32-pack real corpus).** The oracle (`/resave` and
> `/upgrade`) is a **transforming** operation, NOT byte-preserving. It decompresses each inner game file,
> re-compresses it (different block layout ⇒ different bytes), and normalizes/upgrades model `.mdl` files
> (uncompressed size changes). Therefore **any golden diff against ConsoleTools must compare DECOMPRESSED /
> semantic content, never raw compressed payloads** — which requires the SQPack codec. Until codecs exist,
> the container-only layer is validated by a **self round-trip** (our reader→writer→reader, byte-identical
> inner files), which passed 32/32 on the real corpus and needs no oracle. This resolves the open decision
> below: **byte-identical for our own round-trip; semantic/structural for oracle diffs.**

Layers (strongest first):
1. **End-to-end golden diff.** Run `ConsoleTools /upgrade <pack> <golden>` over a corpus of real
   pre-Dawntrail modpacks. The TS port must reproduce each `<golden>` compared on **decompressed** content
   (the oracle recompresses/normalizes — see correction above), not raw bytes.
2. **Component goldens.** Per-transform input→output pairs (mtrl EW→DT, normal→index, eye-mask→diffuse),
   seeded from `/extract` outputs and the bundled `Resources` fixtures
   (`default_material.mtrl` ↔ `default_material_dt.mtrl`, `Colorset.*`).
3. **Binary round-trip parity.** parse→reserialize `.mtrl`/`.tex`/`.ttmp2`/`.pmp` → assert byte-identical,
   **before** testing any transform (isolates codec bugs from transform bugs).
4. **Structural validation.** Upgraded packs re-open/validate; where oracle exists, match the C# golden.

This pairs with TDD at implementation time: round-trip + component goldens become the failing tests
written first.

**Open decision:** byte-identical vs. semantic/structural equivalence as the pass criterion (byte-identical
is easier to automate but brittle to incidental ordering / timestamps).

## 7. Environment notes

- Git repo, published on GitHub as `ffxiv-upgrade-modpack`.
- Reference repos were cloned into the **session scratchpad**, which is **ephemeral** — on resume,
  re-clone `xivModdingFramework` and `FFXIV_TexTools_UI` (URLs in §2) to a stable location (e.g.
  `./reference/`, git-ignored) for source reference.
- Windows + PowerShell. Respect package min-age (7 days) when adding npm deps.

## 8. Delivery status & remaining rounds (living roadmap)

The design is signed off and the build is well underway. The §6 open pass-criterion
resolved to **exact decompressed-byte equality by default, with an explicit
intentional-divergence allow-list** (see the harness spec §4.4). Reference repos, the
corpus, and the cached goldens are all in place. This section is the living map of
what the *full* upgrade comprises and what remains.

### 8.1 Sub-project decomposition

The C# port (`ModpackUpgrader` orchestration + ~2,200 lines of `EndwalkerUpgrade`
transforms) is too large for one spec; it is built as **sequential sub-projects**,
each its own spec→plan→implement cycle. Status as of 2026-07-06:

| # | Sub-project | Spec | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | sqpack / mtrl / tex+BCn / mdl codecs + container I/O (ttmp2 / pmp / legacy) | their own specs (`*-codec-design.md`) | ✅ shipped |
| 1 | E2E golden harness + `/upgrade` cache + baseline ratchet | `2026-07-04-upgrade-golden-harness-design.md` | ✅ shipped |
| 2 | Orchestration + material/colorset round | `2026-07-04-material-colorset-round-design.md` | ✅ shipped (`.mtrl` 416 → 0) |
| 3 | **Model round** — full normalizer, re-scoped into **3a** MDL geometry codec + **3b** model normalizer | `2026-07-06-model-round-design.md` (+ `-model-normalizer-research.md`) | ⏳ **3a** geometry codec ✅ shipped (PR #12); **3b** normalizer pending — 453 `.mdl` |
| 4 | **Texture round** (index maps, gear masks, hair maps) | *(later)* | ⏳ 701 `.tex` |
| 5 | **Metadata round** (EQDP race-set backfill) | *(later; newly scoped)* | ⏳ 49 `.meta` |
| 6 | **Partials + reference-asset bundling** | *(later)* | ⏳ (no corpus coverage yet) |
| 7 | **Site / UI** (static GitHub Pages) | *(later)* | ⏳ |

### 8.2 What each remaining round does

- **Round 3 — Model round (full normalizer).** *Re-scoped 2026-07-06 after the
  FixOldModel finding.* The golden does NOT use the size-preserving
  `FastMdlv6Upgrade` byte-patch; it **normalizes every model** at read time via
  `EndwalkerUpgrade.FixOldModel` (`GetXivMdl → TTModel.FromRaw →
  MakeUncompressedMdlFile`): LoD0-only collapse + v6 + a full **vertex-geometry
  re-encode** (Half→Float precision upgrade). Our structure-preserving `.mdl` codec
  cannot reproduce it, so this is the **largest sub-project** — effectively a new MDL
  geometry codec + a model rebuilder. Split into **3a** MDL geometry codec (vertex
  decl + geometry decode/encode, round-trip tested) and **3b** model normalizer
  (TTModel weld + serializer + gate + wiring). Byte-exact vs golden; no allow-list
  entry. 453 diffs. See `2026-07-06-model-round-design.md` (§0 correction) and
  `2026-07-06-model-normalizer-research.md`. **Update 2026-07-06:** 3a (the MDL
  geometry codec — vertex-declaration codec + geometry decode/encode, corpus
  round-trip verified) shipped via PR #12; 3b (the TTModel weld +
  `MakeUncompressedMdlFile` serializer + gate + wiring) is the remaining work
  that drives the 453 `.mdl` ratchet.

- **Round 4 — Texture round.** Port of `UpgradeRemainingTextures`: consumes the
  `UpgradeInfo` targets the material round records (`IndexMaps`,
  `GearMaskLegacy`/`New`, `HairMaps`) and **generates** the new `.tex` files — the DT
  "index" map from the mod's own normal + colorset, upgraded gear masks, hair maps —
  BCn-encoded. This is the **first round that will not byte-match**: our BC5/BC7
  encoder is not bit-identical to C#'s (BcnSharp/DirectXTex), so every generated
  `.tex` needs an **intentional-divergence allow-list** entry (harness §4.4) that
  positively confirms *only* the block encoding differs (same header/format/dims/mip
  count; decoded pixels within our documented encoder precision). tex+BCn codec
  built. 701 diffs.

- **Round 5 — Metadata round** *(newly scoped — not in the harness spec's original
  five)*. The golden's `.meta` files are consistently **larger** than ours (e.g.
  182→192, 291→313 bytes). Traced to `ItemMetadata` re-serialization: on read,
  `DeserializeEqdpData` **backfills an EQDP row for every race missing from
  `Eqp.PlayableRaces`** (Dawntrail added races, 5 bytes/row —
  `ItemMetadata.cs:782-788`), and the re-serialized metadata carries them. This
  requires a **new metadata codec surface** — we currently pass `.meta` through as
  **opaque bytes** (no `ItemMetadata` parse/serialize exists): parse the synthesized
  `.meta` binary into its EQDP/IMC/EQP/EST/GMP sections, backfill the race set,
  re-serialize. Expected byte-exact. Small (49 diffs) but it is new codec work, not
  just a transform — hence a candidate to fold in alongside the model round.

- **Round 6 — Partials + reference bundling.** Port of the `includePartials`
  heuristics: unclaimed hair textures, eye mask→diffuse, skin repaths. Needs the
  bundled reference assets deferred from §5 (eye textures, iris `(race,face)→path`
  table, canonical hair/ear/tail sampler-path tables). No corpus pack exercises these
  today; the ratchet records them once real mods are added. Most complex; last of the
  transforms.

- **Round 7 — Site / UI.** The actual product (§4): a static GitHub Pages page —
  upload `.ttmp2` / `.pmp` / folder → `upgradeModpack` in-browser → download. The
  transform seam (`upgradeModpack(data): ModpackData`, exported from `src/index.ts`)
  is stable, so the UI can be built in parallel against the current partial pipeline
  and gains correctness as each round lands.

### 8.3 Burndown

The gitignored ratchet baseline **is** the burndown chart (harness §4.5). Total
non-matching diffs across the 46 corpus packs: **1619** at material-round start →
**1203 today** (`.mtrl` 0, `.mdl` 453, `.tex` 701, `.meta` 49). End state: every
baseline empty, with the committed allow-list holding only the intended
texture-encoder divergences.

### 8.4 Path to a complete end-to-end tool & known gaps

**Remaining path.** A shippable end-to-end upgrader is: transforms complete
(rounds 3→4→5→6, which drive the ratchet to zero) **plus** the UI (round 7) wired
to the stable `upgradeModpack` seam. Transforms land in that order; the UI is
decoupled from them (stable seam) and can start in parallel at any point, gaining
correctness as rounds land. "Feature-complete" = the ratchet is empty except for
the intended texture-encoder allow-list; "product-complete" = that, behind the
static GitHub Pages page.

**Known gaps & open risks** (each is a place the system is not yet whole):

- **Thin corpus coverage on already-shipped branches** (material round §10):
  hair rides on **1** pack, CharacterGlass on **2**, and the
  colorset-with-no-normal abandon path is **unit-test-only**. These pass today but
  are under-exercised; widening the corpus with real mods hardens them. This
  concern **rides on every future round**, not just the material one.
- **Partials (round 6) have zero corpus coverage** and depend on **bundled
  reference assets not yet extracted** (eye textures, iris `(race,face)→path`,
  canonical hair/ear/tail sampler tables — §5). Both the assets and the exercising
  mods must be added when that round is built.
- **Metadata (round 5) format is not fully pinned:** the golden `.meta` size
  deltas (e.g. +22 bytes) do **not** fit a pure 5-byte-per-race EQDP model, so a
  short scoping spike is needed before that round can be estimated confidently.
- **Texture (round 4) divergence from TexTools is permanent by design** (our BCn
  encoder ≠ C#'s), bounded and actively confirmed by the allow-list (harness
  §4.4) — the `.tex` baseline reaches "allow-listed", never byte-zero.
- **No CI; the only gate is the local ratchet + ConsoleTools oracle.** A fresh
  clone cannot reproduce the ratchet without the local corpus and cached goldens
  (both gitignored). The gate lives on the maintainer's machine by design (§6),
  which is a resilience gap to be aware of.
- **The site/UI (round 7) is unstarted.** The seam exists and is stable, so this
  is greenfield work rather than a blocked dependency.
