# Backlog

Follow-up work deferred out of the change that surfaced it. See `AGENTS.md` → Conventions
("Deferred work lives in `BACKLOG.md`") for when to add here. Each item cites the audit
finding and/or C# source it traces to, so it can be picked up cold.

## Prioritized

Roughly highest-priority first. Mostly `/upgrade`-pipeline work still to port — the rounds our
pipeline stubs — plus any correctness defect that makes our *output* wrong. Reference:
`src/upgrade/upgrade.ts`, `reference/.../Mods/EndwalkerUpgrade.cs`.

- ~~**A generated texture is written into the PMP with no `Files` key naming it — our upgraded
  packs are functionally broken whenever the texture round fires.**~~ **FIXED (2026-07-13,
  `feat/pmp-writer-regeneration`).** `writePmp`/`optionToJson` (`src/container/pmp.ts`) now
  regenerate `Files`/`FileSwaps`/`Manipulations` from the typed model — via `optionPrefixes`
  (`src/container/option-prefix.ts`) + `resolveDuplicates` (`src/container/resolve-duplicates.ts`)
  — instead of re-emitting `o.raw`'s map verbatim, matching `PopulatePmpStandardOption`
  (PMP.cs:871-928). A file the pipeline adds or repoints now always gets a `Files` key naming its
  real zip path, because the map is derived FROM the model's current file set, not carried through
  from the source. Proven by two independent, previously-red checks going green on all three
  affected packs (`Westlaketea's Constellation Crown`, `[Jaque] Marcellus`,
  `[Jaque] Romeo & Juliet`): the `self:orphan:`/`self:dangling:` self-consistency invariant
  (`test/helpers/pmp-self-consistency.ts`) and the artifact `added`-payload diff
  (`test/helpers/upgrade-archive-diff.ts`) both now report zero for all three. Subsumed the
  `writeTtmp2` round-trip item below (its manifest-regeneration half was the root cause of this
  one too).

- **`writeTtmp2` writes the LEGACY `SelectionType` spelling, and our READER only understands the
  legacy one — so a `Multi` group is silently downgraded to single-select. This makes our
  *output* wrong for users**, the same class as the `Files`-key item above: a mod author's
  multi-select group becomes single-select in the pack we emit, which is a functional
  regression for whoever installs it, not merely a byte-parity nit. `src/container/ttmp2.ts`
  reader: `g.SelectionType === "Multi Selection" ? "Multi" : "Single"`; writer:
  `g.selectionType === "Multi" ? "Multi Selection" : "Single Selection"`. Modern TexTools writes
  the bare enum name (`"Single"` / `"Multi"`), not the legacy `"… Selection"` string.
  **Evidence:** `Fantasia.ttmp2`'s source `.mpl` declares its one group as `["Race","Multi"]`;
  our reader does not match `"Multi Selection"`, so it falls through to `Single`, and our writer
  emits `"SelectionType":"Single Selection"` — while the `/resave` golden emits `"Multi"`. Shows
  as `#/ModGroups/N/SelectionType [mismatch]` + `#/OptionList/N/SelectionType [mismatch]` on 36
  packs in the `/resave` baselines (`test/corpus/.resave-baseline/`).

  **This defect is ALSO already sitting in the `/upgrade` ratchet baselines, not just `/resave`'s**
  (checked 2026-07-13: `Select-String -Pattern SelectionType -Path test/corpus/.upgrade-baseline/*.json`).
  It hits the exact same 36 files as the `/resave` baselines, 643 `SelectionType`-pointer lines total
  (e.g. `7f8d4701a82d….json` alone carries 25: `TTMPL.mpl#/ModPackPages/0/ModGroups/N/SelectionType`
  and `…/OptionList/N/SelectionType` for every group/option in the pack, all `status: "mismatch"`).
  That means the `/upgrade` harness has been **blessing** this defect all along — every affected
  pack's baseline already records the mismatch as "known, ratchet-passing" rather than catching it
  as a regression. It only became legible as a *named, greppable* finding once manifest diffs
  started being reported **per JSON pointer** (Task 2) instead of a single opaque manifest-mismatch
  count; before that this was invisible noise inside an aggregate diff. That is the sharpest
  statement of why the per-pointer harness work mattered: it turned a silently-tolerated defect
  into something you can literally `grep` for and name.

  **Fix (not done here — deliberately deferred):** accept both spellings on read; write the bare
  enum name on write. Note the reader fix changes `ModpackData`, so the `/upgrade` baselines will
  move (in the good direction — the 643 lines above should mostly disappear) once it lands.

- **Partials round.** `partials` (`src/upgrade/upgrade.ts`) is a no-op stub for
  `UpdateUnclaimedHairTextures` / `UpdateEyeMask` / `UpdateSkinPaths` (roadmap round 6).
  Needs the bundled reference assets (eye textures, iris `(race,face)→path`, canonical
  hair/ear/tail sampler tables) — no corpus coverage exercises it yet.

## Unprioritized

- **Port FileSwap handling in the PMP write path (currently: fail loud).**
  `resolveDuplicates` (`src/container/resolve-duplicates.ts`) throws when an option carries a
  non-empty `fileSwaps` map, because this port cannot reproduce TexTools' FileSwap handling
  faithfully with the information available to a browser-targeted library. Full picture, for
  whoever picks this up:

  - **The placeholder mechanism.** In TexTools, `ResolveDuplicates` (`PmpExtensions.cs:476-566`)
    does not run over "just the custom files" — it runs over `WizardStandardOptionData.Files`,
    which `UnpackPmpOption` (`PMP.cs:1104-1137`) builds by merging custom `Files` AND `FileSwaps`
    into one dictionary. On the `/upgrade` load path, `zipArchivePath` is `null`
    (`WizardData.cs:818`: `UnpackPmpOption(o, null, unzipPath, false)`), so `includeData` is
    `false` (`PMP.cs:1015`). For each FileSwap, TexTools resolves the swap's *source* against the
    live game index (`tx.Get8xDataOffset(src, true)`, `PMP.cs:1117`); if that lookup succeeds
    (`offset > 0`), the swap becomes an empty placeholder entry, `ret.Add(src, new
    FileStorageInformation())` (`PMP.cs:1130`) — keyed by the swap's *source* path, not its
    destination, and carrying a default-valued struct (`RealPath == null`, `StorageType ==
    EFileStorageType.ReadOnly`). `WizardStandardOptionData` has no separate FileSwaps field
    (`WizardData.cs:69-80`), so that placeholder flows on as an ordinary `Files` entry and reaches
    `ResolveDuplicates` indistinguishable from a real file.
  - **The idx-burning interaction with the zero-hash bug (`docs/TEXTOOLS_BUGS.md` #8).** The
    placeholder's `RealPath` is `null`, so it fails `File.Exists(f.Info.RealPath)`
    (`PmpExtensions.cs:509`) exactly like an absent PMP file does, and takes the same zero-hash
    sentinel path (`:509-514`) — colliding with every other absent/placeholder file in the option
    and burning an `idx` value that shifts the `common/N` numbering of every genuine duplicate that
    follows it in iteration order.
  - **We cannot reproduce this without a game index.** Deciding whether a given FileSwap yields a
    placeholder (vs. being skipped entirely, `PMP.cs:1118-1122`, `offset <= 0`) requires querying
    the live game's index file via `tx.Get8xDataOffset` — `PMP.cs:1063-1067` opens a readonly
    transaction specifically to do this. This library has no game index and no transaction layer;
    porting this faithfully would mean either bundling/fetching real game index data (out of scope
    for a browser-targeted upgrader) or guessing, which risks silently mis-numbering `common/N` for
    every duplicate after a swap.
  - **TexTools' own writer drops FileSwaps outright regardless.** `PopulatePmpStandardOption`
    (`PMP.cs:873-875`) sets `opt.FileSwaps = new()` and never adds to it — only `opt.Files` and
    `opt.Manipulations` get populated in the function body that follows. So even if we *could*
    reproduce the read-side placeholder mechanism perfectly, the pack TexTools itself writes back
    out loses the FileSwaps entirely; matching TexTools' emitted bytes does not require carrying
    FileSwaps through at all. See `docs/TEXTOOLS_BUGS.md` #10 — adjudicated as a genuine TexTools
    defect (silent data loss on write), not a quirk we need to transcribe.
  - **No corpus coverage.** All 13 real corpus PMPs have `fileSwaps=0`; this is a latent gap with no
    oracle behind it today.
  - **Current behaviour:** `resolveDuplicates` throws a descriptive error citing the above when an
    option's `fileSwaps` is non-empty, rather than risking a silently wrong `common/N` numbering.
    Pinned by a test in `test/container/resolve-duplicates.test.ts`.
  - **To actually fix this:** given TexTools' own writer drops FileSwaps unconditionally
    (`docs/TEXTOOLS_BUGS.md` #10), the pragmatic port-side fix does NOT need the game index at
    all — since our output only needs to match what TexTools writes, and TexTools writes nothing
    for FileSwaps, we could instead *drop* fileSwaps entries before they ever reach
    `resolveDuplicates` (matching the writer's end state) rather than trying to reproduce the
    read-side placeholder/idx-burning mechanics. The one caveat: if TexTools' `/upgrade` needs to
    rewrite a pack that had FileSwaps but doesn't ultimately touch that particular option's payload
    (e.g. the swap survives untouched in a no-op-for-that-option path), the idx-burning could still
    perturb OTHER options' `common/N` numbering in ways a "just drop them" port would miss — this
    needs verifying against a synthetic pack with FileSwaps once one exists before treating "drop
    silently" as safe. Would need a synthetic modpack builder
    (`scripts/generate-synthetics/`) carrying a FileSwaps entry to pin the golden bytes either way.

### Findings from the `/resave` write-side oracle (2026-07-13)

The `/resave` harness (`test/helpers/corpus-resave.ts`) is the first thing in the suite to AB-test our
**writers** against TexTools (`/resave` = `WizardData.FromModpack` → `WriteModpack`, `Program.cs:191-221`
— the same load path `/upgrade` takes, minus the transform). It immediately surfaced the items below.
All are recorded in the per-pack ratchet baselines under `test/corpus/.resave-baseline/`; none are fixed.

**Read this first — what these findings do NOT mean.** A `/resave` divergence is *not* automatically a
bug in our shipped `/upgrade` output. In the two biggest classes below (`.mdl`, `.meta`) our `/upgrade`
output is **byte-identical to the `/upgrade` golden**; the divergence is that we apply a transform at a
*different seam* than TexTools does, which only a load-then-write oracle can see. Fixing them is about
**seam fidelity**, and any fix must keep the `/upgrade` goldens byte-exact.

- **`writeTtmp2` re-emits a SIMPLE pack as simple; TexTools always writes a WIZARD pack.** Confirmed on
  13 corpus packs. `Black Widow.ttmp2`: source `TTMPVersion` `"1.3s"` with a 21-entry `SimpleModsList`
  and `ModPackPages: null`. Our writer emits `"2.1s"` + `SimpleModsList[21]` (`src/container/ttmp2.ts`,
  `TTMPVersion: data.isSimple ? "2.1s" : "2.1w"`). ConsoleTools `/resave` emits `"2.1w"` with
  `SimpleModsList: null` and `ModPackPages: [1]` — one page holding a single group
  `{"GroupName":"Default Group","SelectionType":"Single","OptionList":[1 option]}`. So TexTools'
  `WriteModpack` **has no simple-pack writer at all**: `WizardData` is page/group/option-shaped, and
  everything it writes is a wizard pack. Shows in the baselines as
  `TTMPL.mpl#/ModPackPages [added]` + `#/SimpleModsList [mismatch]` + `#/TTMPVersion [mismatch]`
  (13 packs each). Decide deliberately whether to match this (our simple round-trip is arguably nicer,
  but it is not what TexTools does).

- **`writeTtmp2` omits `.mpl` fields TexTools always writes.** All on 36 packs, all `[added]` (i.e.
  present in the golden, absent from ours):
  - `#/ModPackPages/N/ModGroups/N/OptionList/N/IsChecked` — TexTools writes the option's checked state
    (`true` for the first option of a Single group, `false` otherwise, per the `Fantasia` / `Tight&Firm`
    goldens).
  - `#/ModPackPages/N/ModGroups/N/OptionList/N/ModsJsons/N/ModPackEntry` — TexTools writes
    `"ModPackEntry": null` on **every** mod json (1443 instances).
  - `#/SimpleModsList` — TexTools writes the key as an explicit `null` on a wizard pack; we omit it.
  - Option `Description`: TexTools writes `null` where we write `""` (25 packs,
    `#/OptionList/N/Description [mismatch]`).

- **`writeTtmp2` round-trips `ModsJsons[].Name`/`Category` where TexTools RE-DERIVES them from the game
  path.** `Fantasia.ttmp2`, `chara/bibo/midlander_d.tex`: ours keeps the source's
  `{"Name":"Body - c0201b0001_top","Category":"Body"}`; the golden writes
  `{"Name":"Unknown","Category":"Unknown"}` — TexTools recomputes both from the game path and yields
  `Unknown` for a path it cannot classify (`chara/bibo/…` is not a real game path). 10 packs
  (`ModsJsons/N/Name [mismatch]`), 5 packs (`…/Category [mismatch]`).

- **`writeTtmp2` emits an option's files in a different ORDER than TexTools.** `#/ModsJsons/N/FullPath
  [mismatch]` on 20 packs is (at least largely) an ordering difference, not a content one:
  `Tight&Firm-YorhaCollection-2B.ttmp2` option "Large" — our `ModsJsons[0]` is
  `chara/equipment/e0649/e0649_top.meta`, the golden's is
  `chara/equipment/e0649/material/v0001/mt_c0101e0649_top_a.mtrl`. Both lists have 13 entries. Worth
  confirming it is *only* order before fixing.

- **Our load-fix seam bumps `.mdl` to v6; TexTools' load does not — the v6 bump belongs to the UPGRADE
  caller.** 483 `.mdl` payload diffs across the TTMP corpus, and the single most interesting finding
  here. `normalizeModel` (`src/upgrade/model.ts`) hard-sets `model.mdlVersion = 6` — with the comment
  *"FixOldModel emits v6 (R1: caller-set, ShrinkRay.cs:108)"*, which already says the version is set by
  the **caller**, not by `FixOldModel`. On `/upgrade` that is exactly right; on `/resave` TexTools leaves
  the model at v5. **Evidence** (`Tight&Firm-YorhaCollection-2B.ttmp2`,
  `chara/equipment/e0649/model/c0101e0649_dwn.mdl`): source is 84376 bytes; all three normalized outputs
  are 56184 bytes; TexTools `/resave` = sha `4afb2e51a5bc`, TexTools `/upgrade` = sha `d1b66f709ede`,
  **ours (both paths) = sha `d1b66f709ede`** — i.e. *our `/upgrade` output is byte-identical to the
  `/upgrade` golden*. Diffing the two goldens against each other: 57 differing bytes out of 56184, and
  **byte 0 is `0x05` in `/resave` vs `0x06` in `/upgrade`** (the MDL version), the remaining 56 being the
  v5-vs-v6 bone-set encoding. So TexTools' *load* runs `FixOldModel` **without** the v6 bump, and
  `/upgrade` applies it afterwards. Our `applyLoadFixes` therefore over-reaches. Fix = move the v6 bump
  out of the load seam into the upgrade caller — and keep the `/upgrade` goldens byte-exact while doing it.

- **`.meta` reconstruction is a LOAD/WRITE behaviour in TexTools, but lives in our UPGRADE transform.**
  62 `.meta` payload diffs. TexTools' TTMP load turns a `.meta` file into typed metadata/manipulations
  and its writer turns them back into `.meta` bytes, so a pure `/resave` **grows** the file. Our
  `metadataRound` does the same reconstruction but sits inside `upgradeModpack`, so our `/resave` path
  leaves the source `.meta` untouched. **Evidence** (`Tight&Firm-YorhaCollection-2B.ttmp2`,
  `chara/equipment/e0649/e0649_dwn.meta`): source 182 bytes (sha `24db7b7fd262`); `/resave` golden 192
  bytes (sha `33423dcdfb29`); ours on the resave path = 182 bytes, **unchanged**; ours on the upgrade
  path = 192 bytes, sha `33423dcdfb29` — **byte-identical to the golden**. So `reconstructMeta` is
  *correct*; only its seam is wrong. Same shape as the `.mdl` finding above: decide whether
  `metadataRound` belongs in `applyLoadFixes`, and keep the `/upgrade` goldens byte-exact.

- **`/resave` empirically confirms the unported `FixOldTexData` offset fixup (T2 below).** The remaining
  `.tex` payload diffs are neither format nor dimension nor length changes: `Bloodlust - Bibo+.ttmp2`
  `v01_c0201e0256_top_m.tex` — ours and golden are both `fmt=0x3420 2048x2048 mips=12`, both 2796296
  bytes, and the **first differing byte is at offset 72**; `chained_collars_v1_1_0.ttmp2`
  `v01_c0101a0004_nek_d.tex` — both `16x16 mips=1`, both 208 bytes, first differing byte at **offset 20**.
  Both offsets fall inside the 80-byte `.tex` header, in the **LoD/mipmap offset tables**. That is
  precisely the `ValidateTexFileData` "fix up broken mip offsets" half of `FixOldTexData` that the T2 item
  records as unported. Cross-reference this evidence from T2.

- ~~**PMP: TexTools re-serializes MANIPULATIONS from its typed model too.**~~ **FIXED (2026-07-13,
  `feat/pmp-writer-regeneration`).** Root-caused: `Entry.AttributeAndSound` is `[JsonIgnore]` on
  `PMPImcManipulationJson.PMPImcEntry` (PmpManipulation.cs:318, computed from `AttributeMask`+
  `SoundId` on read) and `ShiftedEntry` is likewise `[JsonIgnore]` on `PMPEqdpManipulationJson`
  (PmpManipulation.cs:435-473) — both are dropped by a real typed round-trip regardless of what the
  source spelled. The `SetId` **value** mismatch (not explained by field presence) turned out to be
  Newtonsoft's numeric-field coercion: `[DVNO] DMBX Shoes 1.pmp`'s source spells
  `"SetId": "295"` (a JSON *string*) on an Eqp/Eqdp manipulation; the typed `uint SetId` field
  deserializes it fine, and the golden re-serializes it as the JSON *number* `295`. Ported in
  `src/container/pmp-manipulation.ts` (`normalizeManipulations`): drops the two `[JsonIgnore]`
  fields and coerces a numeric-string field to a number, for the five subtypes the real corpus
  exercises (Imc/Eqp/Eqdp/Est/Gmp — confirmed by scanning every real corpus PMP's `Manipulations`
  arrays for their `Type` discriminator). Rsp/Atch/GlobalEqp/unrecognized `Type`s pass through
  unchanged (matching Newtonsoft's own untyped fallback subtype, which carries no `[JsonIgnore]`
  field for any of the three) — see the module's own doc comment for the reasoning and the residual
  risk (a numeric-string field on one of those three, unevidenced in the corpus).

- **Make the ConsoleTools oracle async, so the cross-process lock can heartbeat.**
  `withConsoleToolsLock` (`test/helpers/oracle.ts`) is a hand-rolled filesystem mutex: atomic
  `O_EXCL` create, a random ownership token, and break-on-staleness after `LOCK_STALE_MS`. It has a
  documented residual race — breaking a "stale" lock is a *guess* that the holder died, so a live
  holder that overruns `staleMs` can have its lock taken, and its own release then races a
  successor's. Worst case is two concurrent ConsoleTools, which fails loudly (exit -1) and a re-run
  clears; the cache is content-addressed, so nothing wrong is persisted.

  **The proper fix is a heartbeat**, as `proper-lockfile` does it: rewrite the lock's mtime every
  `stale/2` ms so a live-but-slow holder is *never* judged stale (`onCompromised` when that fails).
  We cannot use it — or any heartbeat — today: the critical section is `execFileSync`, which blocks
  the event loop for the whole multi-minute ConsoleTools run, so no timer fires, and `proper-lockfile`
  with `stale` cranked to ~20min degrades to exactly what we already have.

  So: convert the oracle to async (`run`, `unwrapCached`, `upgradeGoldenCached`, `resaveGoldenCached`
  and their sync corpus call sites — Vitest supports async `it`), then adopt `proper-lockfile`
  (`lockSync`→`lock`, `mkdir` acquire, live heartbeat) and delete the hand-rolled lock. Operator's
  call, 2026-07-13: keep the hand-rolled lock for now, do this properly later — it is the better
  long-term shape. See the `withConsoleToolsLock` doc comment for the full reasoning.

- **Port IBM437 (CP437) zip entry-name decoding, matching `Ionic.Zip`.** `src/zip/zip.ts`'s
  `readZip` currently THROWS when a zip entry's UTF-8 general-purpose flag (bit 11) is unset and
  its raw name contains a byte >= 0x80, rather than silently decoding it: fflate's `unzipSync`
  falls back to latin1 for that case, but TexTools unzips via `Ionic.Zip` (`IOUtil.UnzipFiles`,
  `IOUtil.cs:625/654/669`), whose non-UTF-8 fallback is IBM437 — a different mapping above 0x7F, so
  we would otherwise silently resolve a different member name than TexTools does. Porting a real
  IBM437 decode table (256-entry byte→codepoint) would let these packs load, instead of failing
  loud. **No pack in the corpus currently trips the throw** (real corpus mods use ASCII or
  UTF-8-flagged names), so this is deferred until one does, or until we want to widen coverage
  proactively. See `src/zip/zip.ts`'s `findNonUtf8HighByteEntryNames` doc comment for the full
  reasoning, and the CRITICAL review finding that added the throw (PR for
  `feat/pmp-absent-file-tolerance`, 2026-07-12).

  **Empirically confirmed (2026-07-12), not just read from Ionic's docs.** Probe:
  `scripts/probes/probe-cp437-zip.ts` hand-assembles
  a PMP zip byte-for-byte (local file headers + central directory + EOCD, method 0/stored) with a
  payload entry named `[0x78, 0x81, 0x78]` (`'x'`, CP437 `0x81`, `'x'` -- CP437 decodes this to `"xüx"`;
  the same bytes under latin1, fflate's fallback, decode to a control char instead of `'ü'`) and the
  UTF-8 general-purpose flag bit CLEARED, alongside a `default_mod.json` whose `Files` map spells the
  game path's target as real UTF-8 `"xüx"` (`{"chara/test.file": "xüx"}`). Ran ConsoleTools `/resave`
  (pure load -> write, `Program.cs:191-221`) on it and inspected the output:
  - **Output `Files` map:** `{"chara/test.file": "default\\chara\\test.file"}` -- the key **survived**
    (a dropped/absent file would have removed it, per `PMP.cs:883-888`, the same signal
    `probe-resave-absent.ts` uses).
  - **Output zip members:** `default_mod.json`, `meta.json`, `default/chara/test.file` -- a payload
    member exists at the renamed path (`/resave` renames every payload entry, see the `writePmp`
    round-trip item below), and its bytes are the original `[0, 1, 2, 3]` payload verbatim (checked
    directly), not empty or zeroed.
  - **VERDICT: ConsoleTools RESOLVED the CP437-named member.** Ionic decoded the raw `0x81` byte as
    CP437 `'u with diaeresis'`, matched it against the `Files` value, and round-tripped the real payload.
  A control run (folded into the same script, `scripts/probes/probe-cp437-zip.ts`, same hand-rolled zip
  format, plain-ASCII entry name `"xyx"` instead of the CP437 byte) was necessary and used to validate the harness itself:
  the FIRST attempt used a `Files`/game-path key (`"some/random/path.file"`) that doesn't start with a
  recognized `XivDataFile` folder key, so `PMP.cs:752-770` (`CanImport`) silently dropped the file in
  BOTH the CP437 and the ASCII-control run -- a false negative unrelated to zip name decoding. Switching
  the game path to `"chara/test.file"` (a real `XivDataFile` prefix) made the ASCII control resolve
  correctly, confirming the zip-construction and harness were sound, and only then did the CP437 run
  above give the real answer. **This confirms the premise behind the fail-loud throw is correct**:
  Ionic really does fall back to CP437 (not latin1, not UTF-8, not a load error) for an unflagged
  high-byte name, so `readZip`'s divergence from that behaviour is real, and porting an IBM437 decode
  table remains the right fix once a pack needs it.

- **`modelRound` propagates a model-normalizer throw and kills the whole pack; TexTools drops just
  the file.** `src/upgrade/upgrade.ts` (`modelRound`) calls `requireBytes` + `normalizeModel`
  unguarded, so a throw from `normalizeModel` (an unported/unparseable model structure) propagates
  out of `upgradeModpack` and fails the entire `/upgrade`. TexTools does not fail the pack here:
  every caller of `FixOldModel` on the `/upgrade` path wraps it in
  `try { … } catch (Exception ex) { Trace.WriteLine(ex); continue; }` — `WizardData.cs:716-727`
  (the one `ModpackUpgrader.cs:58 -> WizardData.FromModpack` actually takes), and the same shape at
  `TTMP.cs:741-754` and `:1380-1393` — and the `continue` skips the `data.Files.Add` a few lines
  below (`WizardData.cs:729-737`), so the file is silently DROPPED from the option rather than
  killing the pack. Pre-existing (true before the absent-file-tolerance change; unrelated to it —
  an absent file can never reach `modelRound` at all, since absent files are PMP-only and this
  round is gated off for PMP by `needsMdlFix`/`DoesModpackNeedFix`, `TTMP.cs:916`). **Deliberate,
  not an oversight:** fail-loud here is what exposes an unported model structure as a loud failure
  during development instead of silently shipping a pack with a missing model — matching TexTools'
  *outcome* (dropping the file) would require catching the normalizer's throw and removing the file
  from the option, the same shape as `materialRound`'s per-file try/catch. Revisit once model
  normalization coverage is broad enough that a throw here is more likely a real unported case than
  a bug worth surfacing loudly.

- **Audit the port for TexTools bugs we already reproduce, and register them.**
  `docs/TEXTOOLS_BUGS.md` is the register of upstream **bugs** (null derefs, dead guards,
  non-terminating loops, lying exit codes) that we deliberately reproduce for byte-parity, or
  deliberately don't reach, or fail loud on instead. It was seeded from the PMP absent-file
  investigation plus a grep for existing `QUIRK` / `NRE` comments, so it is **not** exhaustive —
  it captures what was in reach, not what is there. Sweep `src/` (and the `reference/` C# it cites)
  for the rest and add an entry per finding. Candidates to adjudicate on the way through, all of
  which are currently only noted in code comments: the EQP set-0 omission
  (`src/meta/reconstruct.ts:190`, `ItemMetadata.cs:522-528`); the `PlayableRaces` vs
  `PlayableRacesWithNPCs` race-order disagreement (`src/meta/playable-races.ts:1`, `Eqp.cs:48-92`);
  `MakePMPPathSafe`'s platform-dependent `Path.GetInvalidFileNameChars()`
  (`src/container/pmp.ts:151`, `PMP.cs:1316-1326`). Each needs the bug-vs-quirk call the register's
  header describes — a faithfully transcribed SE oddity is a quirk and stays a code comment; only a
  genuine defect gets an entry. Useful both as a correctness audit (a reproduced bug we *think* we
  reproduce may not actually match) and as the shortlist of patches we could offer upstream.

- ~~**`writePmp` round-trips the source pack where TexTools *regenerates* it.**~~ **FIXED (2026-07-13,
  `feat/pmp-writer-regeneration`).** Ported: `optionPrefixes`/`resolveDuplicates` regenerate every
  zip member name (`<optionPrefix><gamePath>`, content-deduped into `common/{idx}/`); `writePmp`
  regenerates `Files`/`FileSwaps`/`Manipulations`/`Name`/`Description`/`Image` on every option and
  `Version`/`Name`/`Description`/`Image`/`Page`/`Priority`/`Type`/`DefaultSettings` on every group
  from the model rather than spreading `raw`; `meta.json` is built fresh from the 8 `PMPMetaJson`
  fields every time. Two mechanisms neither this item nor the original design spec anticipated,
  found only by iterating against the `/resave` oracle pack by pack, were needed to reach a clean
  diff on the real corpus:
  - **`CanImport`** (`PMP.cs:752-770`, called from `UnpackPmpOption`, PMP.cs:1075-1078): a `Files`
    entry whose gamePath doesn't start with a recognized `XivDataFile` folder key is dropped
    *entirely* on load, not merely treated as absent — confirmed necessary, not cosmetic:
    `Groove 001.pmp`'s `default_mod.json` carries garbage gamePath keys
    (`"Ear Physics/Off/chara/…"`) that still resolve to real archive bytes and were feeding
    `resolveDuplicates`' shared `idx` counter ahead of the real "Ear Physics" group, swapping which
    of its "On"/"Off" options landed on `common/1` vs `common/2`. Ported in `optionFromJson`
    (`src/container/pmp.ts`).
  - **The `PopulatePmpStandardOption`/default-mod absorption** (`WizardData.cs:1548-1600`): a REAL
    Standard-type group named literally `"Default"`/`"Default Group"` with exactly one option named
    `"Default"`/`"Default Option"` has its regenerated Files/FileSwaps/Manipulations moved into
    `default_mod.json` instead of being written as its own `group_NNN.json` — confirmed via
    `Flower Child - by Solona.pmp`'s `group_001_default.json`. Ported in `writePmp`. **Not fully
    ported**: the C#'s page-renumbering side effect of this absorption (`WizardData.cs:1583-1600`
    increments a *local* page counter only when a page still contributes ≥1 non-absorbed group, so
    an absorbed group that was the only occupant of its page shifts every later page's written
    `Page` number down) is unexercised by every corpus pack that hits absorption (`Flower Child` has
    only one page total) and was NOT ported — `writePmp` still writes each surviving group's source
    `g.page` verbatim. Latent; would show as a `Page`/`pN/` mismatch if a multi-page pack ever hits
    both conditions at once.

  Proven by the `/resave` write-side oracle (Task 5) across all 9 real + 4 synthetic PMP corpus
  packs — every pack's baseline shrank (several to **zero** diffs: `Groove 001`,
  `[Nyameru]Cute Loop`, `[DVNO] DMBX Shoes 1`, all 4 synthetics) — and by the artifact `added`-diff
  and `self:orphan:`/`self:dangling:` self-consistency checks going to zero on the three
  shipping-defect packs (see the item above). One real corpus pack's `/resave` baseline still
  carries a single remaining diff after this fix, and it is NOT this item: `[Jaque] Romeo & Juliet`'s
  `common/24/…id.tex` payload byte-length mismatch. **Correction (2026-07-13, Task 8 review):** an
  earlier pass of this note misattributed that residual to the T2 `FixOldTexData` mip-offset gap —
  wrong, T2's own recorded evidence is *same length, differing header bytes*, whereas this residual
  is a **length** difference (~80/160 bytes, a multiple of the 80-byte null-padding chunk). The real
  cause is a *different*, unported PMP **load-time** fix — see "PMP load-time `.tex` fixup
  (`FastValidateTexFile`) is unported" below.

- **PMP writer: `WizardHelpers.WriteImage` re-encode is unported — `Image` fields and image zip
  members are carried through verbatim, not regenerated.** `WizardHelpers.WriteImage` is called for
  every option (`WizardData.cs:545`), every group (`:953`), and meta (`:1497`): it returns `""` when
  the referenced source file does not exist, else re-encodes the image to a 16-bit PNG under a NEW
  name at `images/<newName>.png` and returns THAT path. `optionToJson`/the group-assembly loop/the
  meta-assembly block (`src/container/pmp.ts`) all pass the SOURCE `Image` value (and, by extension,
  the source image zip member under its original name) straight through instead. **Deliberately not
  ported**: this repo has no image encoder, and porting a real one just to reproduce a PNG re-encode
  is out of proportion to what it buys — several real corpus packs DO carry option/group images (the
  golden's `Image` value AND the image member name/bytes both diverge for any option/group that has
  one; meta images are extinct in the corpus so that particular emit site is empirically unexercised
  today). Each of the three emit sites (`src/container/pmp.ts`) carries an accurate comment noting
  the divergence and citing the C#. If this is ever picked up: it needs (1) a PNG encoder capable of
  16-bit output matching ImageSharp's, and (2) the naming scheme `WriteImage` uses for the new
  `images/<newName>.png` path (distinct per call site — option/group callers pass their own
  `imgName`/`IOUtil.MakePathSafe(Name)`, `WizardData.cs:930-940/953`; meta uses a fixed
  `"_MetaImage"`, `:1497`).

- **PMP manipulation/DefaultEntry normalization fails loud on a missing field instead of emitting
  the C# type's own default.** `normalizeManipulations`/`normalizeImcEntry`
  (`src/container/pmp-manipulation.ts`) require every field of the five known subtypes
  (Imc/Est/Eqp/Eqdp/Gmp) to be present in the source document and THROW otherwise, rather than
  reproducing what Newtonsoft's typed round-trip would actually do — serialize the C# field's own
  default (`0`/`false`/the enum member whose value is `0`) for an omitted key. The honest fix needs
  each field's exact C# type (several are enums — `PMPObjectType`, `PMPEquipSlot`, a race/gender
  enum, a slot enum — and their zero-value member NAME is what Newtonsoft would print, which isn't
  necessarily "the first declared member" or anything guessable without reading each enum
  definition). No real corpus manipulation omits a field (every one spells all of them), so there is
  no golden to prove a default-value guess against; throwing surfaces a genuinely unported shape
  loudly instead of risking a silent wrong value. Revisit if a real pack ever needs a field default:
  read each enum's C# definition, encode the zero-value member name per field, and replace the throw
  with the real default.

- **PMP group with an unrecognized `Type` yields an empty group instead of failing loud.**
  `parsePmpGroup` (`src/container/manifest-types.ts`) defaults `Options` to `[]`, so a group whose
  `Type` is neither `Single`, `Multi` nor `Imc` (or is absent entirely) reads as a group with **no
  options** — its files silently vanish from the model, and `/upgrade` would emit a pack missing
  them. C# cannot produce that outcome: `PMPGroupJson.Options` is a virtual property that **throws**
  on the base class — `NotImplementedException($"Unimplemented PMP group type: {Type}")`
  (`PMP.cs:1407`) — and only the three known subtypes override it with a real `OptionData = new()`
  (`:1413` / `:1421` / `:1434`, selected by `JsonSubtypes` off `Type`, `:1383-1386`). So TexTools
  fails loudly where we quietly drop content, which inverts the port's fail-loud rule (a
  best-effort wrong output that the golden diff could miss, since an empty group also writes back
  empty). Pre-existing — the `?? []` predates the raw/parsed split and was carried through it
  unchanged, so this is not a regression.
  **To fix:** throw from `parsePmpGroup` when `Type` is not a known subtype, mirroring the C#
  message. **First check** what `JsonSubtypes` actually does with an unrecognized discriminator —
  it may throw at *deserialization* rather than reaching the base property, which would change the
  failure point (and whether `LoadPMP` can even load such a pack) — and scan the corpus for an
  unknown/absent `Type` before flipping it, or the ratchet will light up. Presumed latent (a pack
  that hit this would likely already show as missing files against its golden), but that scan has
  **not** been run — do it as step one rather than trusting this note.

- **Serial cache-warm entry point for the corpus.** A cold corpus (new corpus mods, rebuilt
  synthetics, a cleared `.upgrade-cache/`) still spawns ConsoleTools once per uncached entry across
  Vitest's parallel `forks` pool; `withConsoleToolsLock` (`test/helpers/oracle.ts`) now serializes
  those spawns so they succeed instead of failing together, but a full cold-corpus run still pays for
  each spawn's wait-in-queue serially. A dedicated entry point that warms the cache in one pass
  up front (outside the parallel test run) would let a newcomer populate a cold corpus faster.
  Harness convenience; no correctness impact on the port itself.

- **Expected-failure golden capability for the upgrade harness.** The golden harness models only
  two ConsoleTools `/upgrade` outcomes: a produced **pack** or a **noop** marker
  (`GoldenResult = { kind: "pack" } | { kind: "noop" }`, `test/helpers/upgrade-golden.ts:29-31`).
  It has **no way to represent (or cache) an input on which `/upgrade` is *expected to error***. When
  ConsoleTools returns `-1`, `execFileSync` throws inside `run()` in `test/helpers/oracle.ts`, the
  exception propagates out of `upgradeGoldenCached` uncaught, the test hard-fails, and nothing is
  cached — so every subsequent run re-spawns ConsoleTools and throws again. There is no "bless this as
  an expected failure" path (the ratchet baseline only covers known byte-diffs on a *produced* pack).
  If we ever want a corpus pack to assert "TexTools errors here and our port should error the same
  way," add: (1) a third `GoldenResult` kind (e.g. `{ kind: "error", … }`) capturing the failure, (2)
  a cached error-marker analogous to `<sha>.noop` so the outcome is content-addressed and not re-run,
  and (3) a bless path to record it. **Not needed today:** the only expected-failure case in flight is
  the `Mdl.cs:2822` vertex-buffer hard cap, which is covered by a synthetic unit test that drives the
  serializer directly (see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-11-mdl-half-precision-fallback-design.md`
  §4.2-4.3) — the right vehicle regardless, since a ConsoleTools error can't be cached/blessed under
  the current harness anyway. Recorded so the capability is picked up deliberately if a real
  expected-failure corpus pack ever appears.

  **Update (2026-07-13): it has appeared — and it is now a RED test, not a hypothetical.** The `/resave`
  harness has exactly the same two-outcome limitation, and one corpus pack trips it:
  **`Milktruck Bust Scaling Tweaks v1.0.0.ttmp2`** (the only pack of 63 with no `/resave` golden;
  62/63 cached). ConsoleTools exits `-1` and `execFileSync` throws, so the unit hard-fails on every run
  and nothing is cached. The pack is 12 `.rgsp` files (racial scaling) and nothing else. The failure is
  in ConsoleTools' **write** path, and it is **environmental, not a defect in the pack or in our port**:

      System.Exception: CMP Format Changed - Unable to read all CMP data.
         at xivModdingFramework.General.DataContainers.CharaMakeParameterSet..ctor(Byte[] data)
         at xivModdingFramework.General.CMP.GetScalingParameter(...)
         at xivModdingFramework.Mods.FileTypes.PMP.PMP.ManipulationsToMetadata(...)
         at xivModdingFramework.Mods.WizardOptionEntry.ToModOption(...)      [...]
         at xivModdingFramework.Mods.WizardData.WriteModpack(...)
         at ConsoleTools.ConsoleTools.HandleResaveModpack(...)

  On write, TexTools converts each `.rgsp` into an RSP manipulation, which reads the **installed game's**
  `human.cmp`; this TexTools build does not recognize the current game's CMP layout and throws. `/upgrade`
  never hit it because `/upgrade` on this pack is a no-op — ConsoleTools writes nothing, so `WriteModpack`
  is never reached. **This is the real, general reason `/upgrade` can never see a whole class of write-side
  oracle failures**, not a one-off: `/upgrade` only reaches TexTools' writer when the transform actually
  changes something, so any pack whose upgrade happens to be a no-op gets a free pass on every defect in
  TexTools' own writer, this CMP crash included. `/resave` always writes, so it is the only oracle that can
  see this class at all.

  **Update (2026-07-13): the `/resave` half of this item is now DONE.** `resaveGoldenCached`
  (`test/helpers/resave-golden.ts`) gained a `ResaveGoldenResult = { kind: "pack"; bytes } | { kind: "error";
  message }` (mirroring `upgrade-golden.ts`'s `GoldenResult`), catches a `produce()` throw, and caches it as a
  content-addressed `<sha>.error` marker (analogous to `<sha>.noop`) so ConsoleTools is spawned at most once
  for this pack instead of throwing on every run. `registerResaveCheck` (`test/helpers/corpus-resave.ts`)
  treats `{ kind: "error" }` as neither pass nor generic skip: it `console.error`s a loud, explicit message
  naming the pack and the oracle's error text, then calls `ctx.skip(message)` so the test reports as
  **skipped with a note**, not green — the writer is explicitly UNVERIFIED for this pack, never silently
  treated as matching. Covered by a focused unit test (`test/helpers/resave-golden.test.ts`) exercising the
  `opts.produce` injection seam (no real ConsoleTools spawn). Scoped to `/resave` only, per the request that
  landed this.

  **The `/upgrade` half is still NOT done** — `upgradeGoldenCached` / `GoldenResult`
  (`test/helpers/upgrade-golden.ts:29-31`) remains two-outcome (`pack` | `noop`) with no `error` kind, so an
  `/upgrade` input on which ConsoleTools itself errors would still hard-fail every run uncached, exactly as
  described above. No corpus pack currently forces this on the `/upgrade` side (Milktruck's `/upgrade` is a
  no-op, so it never reaches `WriteModpack` there), so it remains deferred until one does — extend
  `upgrade-golden.ts` the same way (`{ kind: "error" }` + `<sha>.error` marker + loud skip in
  `corpus-upgrade.ts`) if/when it's needed.

- **v1 metadata support.** `src/meta/deserialize.ts` now throws on any `.meta` with
  `version !== 2` rather than silently mis-upgrading it. An empirical probe
  (`scripts/probes/probe-v1-meta.ts`: downgrade a real pack's v2 equipment meta to v1 --
  `version=1`, EST/GMP stripped -- run it through ConsoleTools `/upgrade`, inspect the golden)
  confirmed ConsoleTools cleanly upgrades v1 -> v2 by **injecting base-game data** the v1 meta
  lacks, per C#'s `dataVersion==1` default-injection branches:
  - `DeserializeEstData` (`ItemMetadata.cs:823-826`) defaults a missing EST segment to
    `Est.GetExtraSkeletonEntries(root)` -- the est-table (`src/meta/reference/est-table.ts`)
    already supports computing this, so EST injection is portable today.
  - `DeserializeGmpData` (`ItemMetadata.cs:851-855`) defaults a missing GMP segment to
    `GetGimmickParameter(root, true)` -- this needs a **new per-item base-game GMP reference
    table + extraction**, which round 5 deliberately skipped (Task 6 extracted IMC/EST but not
    GMP). Without it, a v1 upgrade can't be reproduced faithfully.
  Extinct in the wild (0 v1 metas across 1431 real corpus `.meta`s), so deferred behind the
  fail-loud guard in `deserialize.ts` rather than ported. Re-run the probe script (still present,
  not wired into the harness) to re-verify against a fresh ConsoleTools build if this is ever
  picked up. `src/meta/serialize.ts` always writes version `2` on output regardless of input
  version (`ItemMetadata.Serialize`, `ItemMetadata.cs:509`), so this is purely a read-side gap.

- **NonSet (weapon/monster/demihuman) IMC reference table.** `src/meta/reference/imc-table.ts`
  (`scripts/extract-meta-reference.ts`) is now **exhaustive over base-game equipment/accessory** —
  it extracts every `(item, slot)` root in the framework's `item_sets.db` `roots` table (~1555
  items / ~7775 keys), so `reconstructMeta`'s IMC step (`src/meta/reconstruct.ts`) covers every
  base-game equipment/accessory item, not just corpus-referenced ones. What remains: `IMC_TABLE`
  is **Set-only**. NonSet items — weapon/monster/demihuman — use a different on-disk `.imc` shape
  (`Imc.cs` `ImcType.NonSet`, a 1-entry default + 1-entry subsets vs Set's 5-slot subsets), so they
  are never extracted, and weapon/monster `.meta`s take the pass-through branch (verified byte-exact
  on the corpus, ratchet-guarded). `parseMetaRoot` recognizes weapon/monster roots (Task 8b) only to
  produce a lookup key that misses `IMC_TABLE`. A general tool wanting NonSet IMC growth needs: (1) a
  NonSet `.imc` parser (the current `parseImcFile` handles only `ImcType.Set`), (2) its own NonSet
  extraction pass over the `weapon`/`monster`/`demihuman` `item_sets.db` roots, and (3) the NonSet
  column selection in `reconstructMeta`. Until then a NonSet meta that *would* grow its IMC silently
  passes through — no corpus pack exercises this, so the ratchet would flag it if a real one did.
  (Note: an equipment/accessory item genuinely absent from the exhaustive table — e.g. added to the
  game after the last `imc-table.ts` regen — now **fails loud** in `reconstructMeta`, signalling
  "regenerate the table", not a silent wrong output.)

- **EQDP reconstruction drops mod rows for non-playable races (latent).** `reconstructMeta`'s EQDP
  step (`src/meta/reconstruct.ts`, round 5) emits exactly the 18 `Eqp.PlayableRaces` in canonical
  order (mod value or 0). C#'s `DeserializeEqdpData` (`ItemMetadata.cs:773-788`) instead keeps
  *every* race the mod file carries and then backfills the missing playable races — so a mod EQDP
  row for a **non-playable** race would be preserved by C# but is silently dropped by our port.
  Unreachable today: game EQDP files are playable-race-scoped, so no real `.meta` carries a
  non-playable EQDP row (flagged in the round-5 final review as a latent fail-loud/fidelity
  asymmetry, unlike the EST/IMC out-of-range cases which were made to throw). Revisit only if a real
  pack ever exercises it; the honest fix is to keep the mod's extra rows (matching C#) rather than
  drop or throw.

- **M1/M2 — empty-sampler placeholder serialization (audit Theme D).** Reproduce, byte-for-byte,
  C#'s quirk where `XivMtrlToUncompressedMtrl` lowercases texture paths (`Mtrl.cs:560`) before its
  UPPERCASE `StartsWith(EmptySamplerPrefix)` exclusion checks, so placeholders are written as
  ordinary textures. `src/mtrl/serialize.ts` currently throws on any empty-sampler placeholder.
  Reproduction also requires matching C#'s placeholder path (`_empty_sampler_` + lowercased
  ESamplerId *name*, whereas `parse.ts` uses the numeric raw id). Needs an authored synthetic
  modpack with an orphan sampler to pin the golden bytes before implementing. Latent (0 unstable on
  the current corpus).
- **F6 — "real data in padding" throw (audit Theme A).** `src/sqpack/blocks.ts` `readBlock`
  omits C#'s `readBlockPadding` throw (`Dat.cs:2400-2405`) because that throw is gated on
  whole-`.dat` context (`lastInFile && i != blockCount - 1`) our single-file block reader does
  not carry. Documented as a code comment rather than ported, since a partial reproduction would
  risk over-throwing on legitimately-tolerated padding. Revisit if we ever thread archive-level
  read context (which file/block is last) into the block loop. Malformed-input-only + latent.

- **T2 — full `FixOldTexData` load-time round (only the drop-malformed subset is ported).** The
  texture round (round 4) surfaced that TexTools runs every `.tex` in an old pack (TTMP major < 2,
  or exactly 2.0) through `FixOldTexData` at **load** time (`TTMP.cs:1413-1460`, called from
  `MakeFileStorageInformationDictionary` `TTMP.cs:1367-1379`), gated by `DoesModpackNeedFix`
  (`TTMP.cs:916-930`). We ported **only the drop-on-decode-failure slice** (`src/upgrade/texfix.ts`
  `needsTexFix` + `texFixRound`, mirroring the `try { FixOldTexData } catch { continue }` that drops
  malformed placeholder textures — the fix for the 8 `hd_bunny_sluts` index regressions). The
  **remaining** `FixOldTexData` behaviour is unported: (1) `ValidateTexFileData`
  (`EndwalkerUpgrade.cs:2100`) — resize a NPOT texture that has >1 mip up to power-of-two (needs the
  **ImageSharp Bicubic resampler**, still deferred — same dependency as the texture round's resize
  gap), and fix up broken mip offsets; (2) the **unconditional recompress** of every kept `.tex` via
  `Tex.CompressTexFile` (`TTMP.cs:1436`). The recompress is invisible to our golden harness (it
  compares decompressed content, and recompression preserves it), so it is low-priority; the
  NPOT-resize *does* change decompressed content and would show as a golden diff if any old-pack
  corpus texture is NPOT-with-mips. This is a load-time round analogous to the model round's
  `FixOldModel`; scope it as its own spec→plan when the resampler lands or a corpus pack demands the
  resize. No corpus coverage forces it today (the ratchet will flag it if a real pack does).

  **Update (2026-07-13): the `/resave` write-side oracle now forces the *mip-offset-fixup* half.** It is
  no longer coverage-free: the `.tex` payload diffs in the `/resave` baselines are exactly this. Same
  format, same dimensions, same mip count, same total length — only the LoD/mipmap **offset tables**
  inside the 80-byte header differ (`Bloodlust - Bibo+.ttmp2` `v01_c0201e0256_top_m.tex`, first differing
  byte at offset 72; `chained_collars_v1_1_0.ttmp2` `v01_c0101a0004_nek_d.tex`, at offset 20). The
  offset fixup needs no resampler, so it can be ported independently of the NPOT-resize half (and of T3).
  See the `/resave` findings section above.

- **PMP load-time `.tex` fixup (`EndwalkerUpgrade.FastValidateTexFile`) is unported — a DIFFERENT
  gap from T2, misattributed to it in an earlier pass of this file.** `ResolvePMPBasePath`
  (`PMP.cs:78-90`) runs every unzipped `.tex` through `EndwalkerUpgrade.FastValidateTexFile`
  immediately after unzip (`PMP.cs:86`, inside a `try { } catch { }`), and `UnpackPmpOption` runs it
  again per-file when not already unzipped (`PMP.cs:1084-1091`) — i.e. this is a **PMP load-time**
  fix, unlike T2's `FixOldTexData` (TTMP-load-gated only, `DoesModpackNeedFix`/`TTMP.cs:916`).
  `FastValidateTexFile` (`EndwalkerUpgrade.cs:2132-2165`) does two things: (1) `FixUpBrokenMipOffsets`
  — the SAME mip-offset-table repair T2 already tracks (shared with `ValidateTexFileData`); (2)
  **truncates trailing null padding** — "Textools would repeatedly add 80 null bytes to the end of
  textures" (`EndwalkerUpgrade.cs:2149-2165`) — which T2 does NOT cover (T2's own recorded evidence
  is *same-length, differing header bytes*; a null-padding truncation is a *length* difference).
  **Evidence:** `[Jaque] Romeo & Juliet [feb 2023] - DT update.pmp`'s sole remaining `/resave`
  residual after the writer-regeneration fix (see the item above) is `common/24/…id.tex`, a payload
  **byte-length** mismatch (~80/160 bytes, a multiple of the 80-byte padding chunk) — exactly this
  fixup's signature, not T2's. Neither half is ported: our `applyLoadFixes`
  (`src/upgrade/upgrade.ts` / the `/resave` harness's load-fix seam, `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-12-pmp-writer-regeneration-design.md`
  §4.3.1) has no PMP branch at all today — that spec's §4.3.1 claimed "PMP has no load-time fixes at
  all (both are TTMP-gated)", which this finding shows is false; the spec text has been corrected in
  place, but `applyLoadFixes` itself has NOT been extended. **Consequence:** any PMP `.tex` carrying
  either broken mip offsets or trailing null padding diverges from the `/resave` golden (and, by the
  same load-time reasoning, potentially from the `/upgrade` golden too, though no corpus pack
  currently forces that side). Not ported here — deliberately deferred, same shape as T2: port the
  mip-offset half together with T2's (shared `FixUpBrokenMipOffsets`/`ValidateTexFileData` logic) and
  the null-padding truncation as a small addition, gated on PMP rather than on `DoesModpackNeedFix`.

- **T3 — ImageSharp Bicubic/NearestNeighbor resampler (texture-round resize skips + T2).** The
  texture round throws `TextureResizeUnsupported` (caught → skipped, baselined) whenever a
  generation source is non-power-of-two (`CreateIndexFromNormal` `:1098`, `UpgradeMaskTex` `:2088`)
  or a hair normal/mask pair differs in size (`ResizeImages`, `:1205`). C# resizes via ImageSharp
  (Bicubic, or NearestNeighbor for the pow2 pre-step). **Real corpus case:** `Misty_Hairstyle_Female.ttmp2`
  hits the hair size-mismatch branch twice (normal 4096² vs mask 1024², c0101/c0201 h0170) — currently
  baselined skips. **No NPOT source exists anywhere in the ~940-pack scan**, so the NPOT branch has zero
  real coverage (synthetic-only when built). Porting an ImageSharp-faithful Bicubic resampler is the
  shared dependency for these skips AND T2's `ValidateTexFileData` NPOT-resize; byte-parity against
  ImageSharp's float math may be machine-dependent (see texture-round spec §4.4) — likely needs a
  scoped per-pixel-threshold `DIVERGENCE_RULES` entry for resized outputs. Own spec→plan.

- **T4 — `index-path-overrides` table missing `chara/equipment/e0208` (and likely other) base-game
  entries.** `The_Final_Requiem_veil.ttmp2` overwrites base-game e0208 materials; the golden's index
  path uses the canonical override (`EndwalkerUpgrade.cs:923-936`) but `src/upgrade/reference/index-path-overrides.ts`
  has no e0208 c0101 entry, so we emit at the convention path (golden has `_met_id.tex` we don't →
  `#0:added`) and the two e0208 `.mtrl` mismatch. The index generation itself is byte-exact once pointed
  at the right path (triage-confirmed). Fix mechanically by re-running `scripts/extract-index-overrides.ts`
  against a game install to widen the table; the ratchet baselines the gap until then.

- **Vet page-load and upgrade-operation performance once a working webpage exists.** The
  library is consumed client-side, but there is no real page to profile yet. When one lands,
  measure the two things that matter to a user: (1) **initial page load** — JS parse/eval and
  time-to-interactive, and (2) the **upgrade operation itself** — wall-clock and peak memory of
  running `upgradeModpack` over representative packs. Profile the real app on real hardware
  (include a low-end/mobile-class device), find where the time and bytes actually go, and only
  then decide whether anything is worth optimizing. Keep the investigation unbiased — do not
  presume a culprit. One incidental data point already gathered (2026-07-11): the current lib
  build is `dist/index.js` 1,568 KB raw / 111 KB gzip, of which the two generated base-game
  reference tables (`src/meta/reference/imc-table.ts`, `est-table.ts`) are ~90% of the raw bytes
  but only ~62% of the gzip (they're highly repetitive, so gzip/brotli crush them). That suggests
  wire size is already small and any real cost is more likely eager parse/eval or the upgrade
  compute path — but treat that as a hypothesis to test, not a conclusion, and let the profiler
  point at whatever is actually hot. Housekeeping / perf; no correctness impact.

- **Audit temp-dir usage for leaks (`mkdtemp` cleanup).** Several helpers create OS temp working
  directories via `mkdtempSync(join(tmpdir(), …))` but never remove the *directory* (only inner
  files), so they accumulate across runs. The worst offenders run on **every `npm test`**:
  `ORACLE_TMP` in `test/helpers/oracle.ts` (`oracle-*`, a per-worker module singleton, never rm'd)
  and `test/helpers/upgrade-golden.ts:49` (`upgrade-*`, `UPGRADE_TMP`, never rm'd) — these left the
  stale `oracle-*`/`upgrade-*` dirs found on 2026-07-10. Occasional offenders: `scripts/extract-index-overrides.ts:87`
  (`idxover-*`) and `scripts/extract-shader-params.ts:26` (`shparam-*`) (manual runs), and the test
  files `test/oracle-cache.test.ts` (`oc-*`) / `test/upgrade-harness.test.ts` (`ug-*`/`ub-*`).
  **Good examples to follow:** `test/sqpack/fixtures/regen.ts:64` and `test/tex/fixtures/bcn/regen.ts:431`
  both `rmSync(tmp, { recursive: true, force: true })` when done. Fix: give each `mkdtemp` site a
  guaranteed cleanup (try/finally, `afterAll`, or a `process.on("exit")` unlink for the singleton
  harness dirs), and consider a lint/grep guard so new `mkdtemp` calls without a paired removal are
  caught. Note `sweepStaleTemps` in `test/helpers/oracle.ts` already sweeps stale `.tmp` files in its
  *cache* dir — extend
  that discipline to the mkdtemp working dirs. Housekeeping; no correctness impact.
